# Reason Impossible: Can LLMs Forecast Wartime Returns?
This project examines how **Large Language Models (LLMs)** can facilitate research and inform decision-making in **migration**, **crisis response**, and **social policymaking**.


## Research Questions

For the initial study, we are investigating the following research questions:

- **How well can LLMs forecast crisis-induced temporal return migration patterns using real-world data from the Ukraine–Russia war? (RQ1)**

- **How do LLMs reason about their forecast? (RQ2)**

- **How robust are the forecasting performance and reasoning processes? (RQ3)**
